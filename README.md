# Expense-Tracker

1. Features:

User Management:
   - Registration, login, and logout functionalities to manage user sessions securely.
   - Each user has a username, password, and a list of associated expenses.

Expense Tracking:
   - Users can add expenses with a specified date, category, and amount.
   - Expenses are associated with the currently logged-in user.

Listing and Sorting:
   - Listing expenses with options to sort them by date or category, enhancing user accessibility.

Category-wise Summation:
   - Displaying the summation of expenses grouped by category for a better understanding of spending patterns.

Data Persistence:
   - Saving and loading user and expense data to/from a file (`expense_data.txt`) using serialization, ensuring data integrity across sessions.


2. Design:

Object-Oriented Approach:
   - Utilized object-oriented programming with classes (`Expense`, `User`, `ExpenseTracker`) to model the entities and interactions within the expense tracker system.
   - This allows for encapsulation, abstraction, and easier maintenance of code.

Serialization for Persistence:
   - Employed Java's serialization to persistently store user and expense data in a file (`expense_data.txt`).
   - Serialization ensures that data is saved between sessions, providing a seamless user experience.

Menu-Driven User Interface:
   - Designed a console-based menu-driven interface in `ExpenseTrackerApp` for user interaction.
   - The menu structure allows users to register, log in, log out, add expenses, list expenses, display category-wise summation, and exit the application.

Date Formatting and Sorting:
   - Implemented date formatting using `SimpleDateFormat` to ensure consistent representation.
   - Incorporated sorting options for listing expenses based on date or category, enhancing user flexibility.

Exception Handling:
   - Integrated exception handling, such as catching `ParseException` when parsing dates, to provide informative error messages to users.


3. Challenges:

Date Formatting:
   - Ensuring the correct format for date input and output. The mistake in the date format (using "DD" instead of "MM") needed attention to avoid errors.

Serialization/Deserialization:
   - Managing serialization/deserialization correctly to prevent data corruption or loss. Error handling for these operations is crucial.

Menu Structure:
   - Designing an intuitive menu structure that accommodates various user actions while maintaining simplicity can be challenging. User experience considerations are vital.

Security:
   - Ensuring the security of user data, especially with password handling. Additional security measures, like hashing passwords, could be implemented.

Input Validation:
   - Implementing robust input validation to handle potential user errors and prevent unexpected behavior.

Code Organization:
   - Balancing code conciseness with readability. Proper organization and commenting are essential for understanding and maintaining the codebase.


4.Conclution:
 -The Java code presents a practical expense tracker with user registration, login, and expense tracking. Its object-oriented structure and serialization support data persistence. Improvements can be made in security, error handling, and additional features. Overall, it offers a solid foundation with potential for enhancement.
